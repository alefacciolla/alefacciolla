- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alexandre Facciolla (@alefacciolla here, or @facciolla.bsky.social - BlueSky)
- ðŸ‘€ I work and am interested in Data Driven Journalism (DDJ) and Linux enviroment - I'm using now Linux Mint 20.1 (Ulyssa) and trying to work with others distributions with Virtual Box.

- I have been working as a journalist since 2009, and with data-driven journalism since 2021, when I started my post-graduation in DDJ (MBA from IDP - 2021/2022). One of my main goals is to learn and contribute to projects that work with environmental data and the climate crisis.
    For this, the tools I have used the most are:<p>
        1 - Python programming language
            - Focused on data analysis, visualization and geodata<p>
        2 - QGIS for map visualization and data analysis<p>

- I am co-author of the app and website "Brasil na COP" - https://www.brasilnacop.com/ 
            The project - carried out in partnership with friends Nicolas Llano (@nllano) and FÃ¡bio Fleury - is based on the collection, categorization, analysis and public availability of speeches by the Brazilian government (made by its representatives) between 2004 and 2021 during the Conferences of the Parties (COP) - specifically, the speeches delivered in the high-level segment and plenary session of these conferences.
